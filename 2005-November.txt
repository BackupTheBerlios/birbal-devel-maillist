ok. how would you like to proceed? We would need you to give the 
system study on which we would develop the module which will be 
online so you can test and give us the feedback to perfect it. We 
are developing using an svn repository in berlios.de. The system 
study will also be put up there. There are three ways you can 
interact with us:
1. by mail to us individually 
2. by mail to the birbal-devel mailing list
3. by directly commiting to the repository and discussing this on 
the mailing list.

The third option is most preferrable as it offers complete 
interaction. You will need to learn a little bit of svn commands - 
just three or four commands are enough, if you are not familiar 
with it we can guide you in this. Please let us know your 
preference and we can get started.

for registration of births and deaths a systems study means what 
data has to be entered and what the workflow should be: Something 
like this for births:

workflow
1. birth reported (verbally written through the web)
2. report recorded
3. report verified
4. verification checked
5 information entered into the register
6. inacuracies, corrections, deletions - how are they dealt with
data
fathers name, mothers name - what data is needed
of this data what is public and what is confidential

Similarly for registration of death

If we have these details we can set up the module and fine-tune it. 
If you could mail this with sample data, we will put it online and 
then you could access and tell us how to improve it.

The next step would be the immunisation schedule
